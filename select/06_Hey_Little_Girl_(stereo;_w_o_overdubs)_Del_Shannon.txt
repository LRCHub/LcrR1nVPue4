Last night I walked through the streets of my town
I saw the shadow of a girl I had known
And through the shadows, I could see many tears
And so I walked up and I said

Hey! Little girl, let me fix your broken heart
I'll replace each broken part that's gone
Because I know, I could try
Hey! Little girl, my heart's been broken too

Do you remember last September
When I met you at a dance?
You were with a guy named Joe
And all at once he said, you had to go
I never even caught your name, oh yeah

Hey! Little girl, I've been searching everywhere
Here, there, everywhere for you
Because I have cried for you
Hey! Little girl, I'm so in love with you

Hey! Little girl, I can see that he was mean
He shattered all the dreams you had
So come with me and see
Hey! Little girl, I'll make all your dreams come true

Ooh yeah
Come, little girl, I'll make all your dreams come true
Ooh yeah
Come, little girl, I'll make all your dreams come true
