Hey little girl in the high school sweater, gee, but I'd like to know you
Better.
Just swingin' your books and chewin' gum, lookin' just like a juicy plum
Hey, hey, little girl.

Hey little girl in the black silk stockings, gee, but you got my heart
A-rockin'.
Wearin' that crazy skin tight skirt, and that crazy Ivy League shirt hey,
Hey little girl.

Hey little girl, can I come along?
Carry your books and hold your arm, yeah.
Hopin' that you'll tell me yes, 'cause your the girl that I love the best.

Hey, hey, little girl.
Hey, hey, little girl.

Hey little girl in the high school sweater, gee I hope your feelin' better.
Not just like the time before, remember when you closed that door?
Hey, hey, little girl.

Hey, little girl, can I come along?
Carry your books and hold your arm.
Hopin' that you'll tell me yes, 'cause your the girl that I love the best.
Hey, hey, little girl.
Hey, hey, little girl.
