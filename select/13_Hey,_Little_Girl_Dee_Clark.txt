Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, but I'd like to know you better
A-just a-swingin' yo books and chewin' gum
A-lookin' just like a juicey plum
Hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Little girl

Hey, little girl in the black silk stockins
Gee, but you've got my heart a-rockin'
A-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt
And that crazy ivy league shirt!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, little girl

Hey little girl, can I come along
Carry your books and a-hold your arm?
I'm hopin' that you tell me, yes
Because you're the girl that I love best
Hey, hey-hey-hey

A-hey-hey

Um-hm, um-hm

Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, I hope you're feelin' better
Not just like the time before
'Member when you closed that door?
Hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
Little girl
